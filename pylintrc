[REPORTS]

# Set the output format. Available formats are text, parseable, colorized, json
# and msvs (visual studio). You can also give a reporter class, e.g.
# mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.
output-format=colorized


[FORMAT]

# Use max line length of 100
max-line-length=100

# Regexp for a line that is allowed to be longer than the limit.
# URLs and pure strings
ignore-long-lines=^\s*(# )?<?https?://\S+>?$|^\s*[f|r|u]?b?[\"\'\`].+[\"\'\`]$


[DESIGN]

# Maximum number of branch for function / method body.
max-branches=15


[BASIC]

# As far as I can tell, PEP-8 (Nov 1, 2013) does not specify
# a specific naming convention for variables and arguments
# prefer mixedcase, starting with a lowercase or underscore
variable-rgx=[a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{1,29}[A-Za-z0-9_]$

# Good variable names which should always be accepted, separated by a comma.
good-names=e,_


[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
